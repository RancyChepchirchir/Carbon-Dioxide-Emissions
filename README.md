# Carbon Dioxide Emissions and the Economy
## Abstract
Some believe that combatting climate change stunts economic growth. However, in the United States, this is a false choice. The relationship between carbon dioxide emissions (a major greenhouse gas contributor) is compared to GDP. The visualization shows that a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions does not actually inhibit GDP growth, as some may believe. 

## Methods
The World Bank is scraped for per capita GDP data as well as per capita carbon dioxide emissions over time. Since the Clean Air Act was enacted in 1970, years before 1970 are excluded. Years without data points for both GDP and CO2 are also excluded. A scatter plot is created to show the relationship between the two variables. A time series for each variable is also included.

## Results and Discussion
The scatter plot in the visualization below shows a general negative relationship between GDP per capita and CO2 emissions per capita. This indicates that reducing carbon dioxide emissions does not actually inhibit GDP growth, as some may believe. The time series gives a closer look and shows a general increase of GDP per capita over time and general decrease of CO2 emissions per capita over time. GDP per capita has a pretty steady increase from 1970 to 2014. Carbon dioxide emissions has a relatively steep downward trend during the 1970s, which coincides with major environmental legislation. It then remains fairly constant until the early 2000s, when a steep downward trend occurs once again.
